## How i convert the python code to runable exe?
I used [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/) which under the hood uses pylinter . My diffecultiy was that i seperated my pictures to seperate folder and didn't find a convient way to bundle them .

One issue that I encounterd was that the conversion had a issue with using default python font so I supplied a ttf file bundled up which fixed it .
